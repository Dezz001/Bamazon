The purpose of this program is to simulate an online store called BAMAZON. My program will simulate the customer’s front-end interface utilizing the windows terminal and using “node bamazon.js” to begin the program.
My tools package for this assignment includes MAMP as a server, mySQL to develop the database, Subline Text 3 to host the developed code in javascript, Node to begin the program, git hub to host the final codes for project submittal and Google Drive to host videos illustrating how the program works.

Thank You
